Hello ! This is a dialogue dialogue box
this, too, is a dialogue line
This is good for testing purposes
Character count for SDL_Limit, because yknow maybe 255 is a lot and we could go lower, assuming the program even compiles at all which is not a given in this fucking economy with all the shitty shitheads and all the things and yeah I hate myself and I wanna die and cry
Oh hi mark
